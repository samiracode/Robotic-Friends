### What is Robotic-Friends about?

Robotic-Friends is an app writen by React and has tachyons package for its css design. 
It has a search box to find a robot-user and the data is provided by an API.
The purpose of this practice was to challenge my ability to creat react components with class instead of function. This is amazing for understanding how state management 
works under the hood.
